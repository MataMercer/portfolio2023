	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>
		Hello! My name is Mercer Denholm, and I'm a developer located in üçä Orange County, California.
		In 2019, I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science from California State University,
		Long Beach. I have struggled to find a developer position since then, but I have been working on
		projects to improve my skills. I will try to keep this website updated with new information
		regarding ongoing projects. When I'm not programming, I work part time at a store. Because of
		this, progress might be slow and varied. I'm also currently seeking work. You can find my resume
		on LinkedIn.
